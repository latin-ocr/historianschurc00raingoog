viii sarraca

the short biographies of him which I print seem to
anticipata his canonization, but Tburstan's body was laid
by his own request in the prioryof St. John at Ponte-
fract, and its removal to York would never have been
permitted. Upon William Fitzherbert, therefore, late in
the history of the ohurch of York, devolved the honour
oi being her special patron and representative. The “
missortunes oi that good and ill-used man attracted the
sympathy of the men of Yorkshire. It was the same
feeling in a later day that led them to regard Archbishop
Scropeasasaint,andinducedtheimpassionedLancastrian
to bend his lrnee before the statue of Henry VI. The
greater part of these two volumes is taken up with the
[rives and Mircelcs of the Saints connected with York
llinster.

The other subject which occupies so large a space in
these volumes is acontroversial one-the account, Ι
mean, of the struggle between York and Canterbury,
wh'ether the latter should receive the allegiance os tha
other or not. From the sevcnth century to the fonr-
teenth this contentiori went on with many vicissitudes,
and varying success. It came to a climax, as will be
sesnin the time of the four archbishops of York who
came next after the conquestos whom Thmstan was
the last and most conspicuous, The narrative of Hugh
Sotevagina, which is printed for the first time in this
volume, givesa lifelike picture cf the struggle during
the archiepiscopate of Thurstan, and we ean see srom the
writer’s eamestness that the question was one almost of
life and death to the church of York. The case for tho
ohurch of Canterbury is very admirably put by Arch-
bishop Ralph in his letter to Oalixtus II, but there is
much special pleading init. 'l'he writer keeps in the
background the injunctions of Gregory, and males the
most of the eompliance with the claim which the three
earliest Norman archbishops of York had undoubtedly
made.
