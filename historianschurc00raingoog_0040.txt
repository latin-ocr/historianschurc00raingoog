as one ol the Vicars of Ripon Minster (Memorinls of
Ripon‚ ii. 133). Itis probable that he died shortly .
afterwards as he is not among the six vicars who pnid
their obedience to the same archbishop in December
1380 (Reg. Neville, i. 9).

Itis evident‚ therefore, that Allhallowgate was con-
nected with Ripon‚ The words which begin the prefacc
to the poem “Roscronte nobis tn complicante tuba
lotis? show Ι think, that what he wrote was, like the
first metrica] chronicle, affixed to a wooden board or
tryptieh like that in the vestry at York. This tryptich
must have been intended for the vestry at Ripon. It
contained what was of tho greatest interest to the inhabi-
tants of that place, and ended with the Life of Wilfrid
junior, the nephew of the elder and greater Wilfrid. His
main thome is, of course, the elder wilfrid, tho founder
and patron of his minster, whose merits he descants upon,
and whose translation by Arohbishop Gray he alludes
to. His information was derived probably from the
lections in the service books. One of these, a MS. which
seems to have been for the use of the church of Ripon
itselfi has been very generously purchased and deposited
in the minster library there by the present Marquess of
Ri on.

Ilhe poem of Allhallowgate, which ended with lino
124, was continued by some other chentry-priest or
vicar in the same minster of Ripon‚ “ simplem iu eadent
‘¹ ecclesio presbyter sacoedmcm? who carried it on to
the archiepiscopate of William Booth. The name of
this poet has not been preserved.

The textis taken from MS. Rawlinson at Oxford,
No. 446. This is indto. inallith century hand. The
volume also contains some notiees of the minster of
Beverley and of the family of Percy.

With this another MS. (A.) has been collated, te, MS. “

Cotton, Cleopatra, d. iv„ of which a description has just
been given.
