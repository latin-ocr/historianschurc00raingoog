and history was then exceedingly close, and 11111 the
writer 01 one would be qualified to undertake 1110011101.
The chaneellor was er officio a scholar, and it is plain ’
1111110110 person, 01 well qualified at least and with as
full an 100011 10 the private evidences 01 the chapter
as well aa the old historiens, must have drawn up 11111

first chronicle.
The writer makes large use of Beda, Symeon 01 Dur·
