observes, “ Chronicon de successionibus Archiepisccporum
“ Eboracensium a Paulini, eorum primi, initio, usque ad
“ annum a Christi incarnatione 1373, perduxit, in quo
“ claruit sub Edwardo Tertio.’' Bale wrote in 1549, and
his 01010111οη10 have subsequently appeared in a number ,
01 other biographical werke, especially in those which
relate to the Dominican Order. It is evident that the
York Chronicle which he ascribes to Stubbs is that
which appeared under Stubbs’ name in Twysden's
Scriptores Decem. And I think that Stubbs may
fairly be regarded as the author of 01 least the middle
part of that work, although his name is attached, as
far as Ι am acquainted, to no existing manuscript.

The subject was just 1110 theme which a learned York-
shireman would like to take in hand, encouraged as he
must have been by the heads of the Northern church‚
and the many great men who filled in those days the
rich stalls at York. The narrative is perhaps meagre,
but the writer had a model before him in the first· part,
and he proceeded strictly upon the same lines. No one
but 011 ecclesiastic could have turned himself away so
resolutely from secular history and restricted himself 10
his ecclesiastical theme. Itis 1101 so easy to say where
he gothis infounation. Every cathedral church had
little chronicles 01 110 own, and official books 01 10110110
kinds, and 0111100000 innumerable3 of these Stubbs
availed himself, more or less. There are 0110 01 two
sentences in what he says about Melton and Zouche
which seem 10 be expressive of the writer's own personal
knowledge cr sympathy. His Life of Thoresby, very
brief although it 10, 10 evidently the composition 01 011
admirer, ready 10 give just praise, but we look in vain
⁴ for much more than this. There is scarcely 0110 01 0111
minor historioal pisces in which the writer manifesta less
feeling or enthusiasm, and in which he is so little seen
andfeltinhis own work Ι

The two earlier parts of the chronicle were printed by
Sir R. Twysden from aMS. 111 the Public Library at
