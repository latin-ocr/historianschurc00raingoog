Oxford. He publishes both together, as one work, under
the name of Stnbhs.

The third part oi the chroniole, of which there are
two MSS. in existence, carries the series of archbishops
from Alexander Nevillc to Wolsey. This part is printed
here for the first time. Although very brief and frag·
mentary, the narrative gives many interesting facts
which may be looked for in vain elsewhere, and which
no one could have known but some one who was well
acquainted with York and ite ecclesiastical history. If
Imay hazard a conjecture as to the author,I should
namo William Melton, chancellor of the minster, 1496-
1528. Η1 was a scholar of renown‚ and if he drew up
this final memorial of the arohbishops he was not only
performing a congenial task bnt was fulfilling one of the
statutory duties of his office. Melton was one of the
most learned men that ever held the dignified office of
ohmcellor at York. He published what is now 1 very
rare tract, a “Sermo cancellarii Ebor.'’ which Wynkyn
de Worde printed for him. In the inventory of his
effecte, drawn up after his decease in 1528, we havea
charming picture of the home of a great scholar. Among
a numerous list of books I make a few selections: “ His-
“ toria de Vita Pontificum‚’' valued at 311, which might

. possibly be the chronicle of which I am writing. He¹

possessed also “Liber Vitae Hugonis de Lincoln.''
“Liber Roberti Gaguinii de (iestis Francorum,'’ xiid.
·‘ Liber Bedae da (lestis Anglorum,” ii. s. “Liber de
“Historia Ecclesiastica,” iiii. cl. “Liber Oronicorum
“ Volotharen '’ (aio) iii. s. ; this is Volterra in Italy.

The following MSS. are made use of and make up a
very good text of these Chronioles.
