Ι1 these two subjeots are taken out 01 these volumes
the residue is little mors than 0 portion of thc chronicle
01 Thomas -Stubbs, and its continuation. But theosin

St, Oswald, commenced in Vol. Ι. We have here tbe
Life by Eedmm, tho well-known Canterbury historian
(000 prefacc to Vol. 1., p. xlii„ et seqq). This is divided
