Monmouth, ond then goes on to the mission of Gregory,

and the conversion oi Northumbria by Paulinus. A
slight sketch of Wilfrid end ligbert, and a mention of

Athelston and his privileges bring the writer to the
‘Norman Conquest He then describes the work of
Thomas I. and Thurstan, and ends with sn enumemtion
of the suffragans of York, and an eppeal for the recovery
of the allegiance of the Scottish sees. In the prologus
the author ssys that he wrote his poem during the archie-
piscopste of the fourth Thomas. This was Thomas
Arundel (1388-97). The name of the poet is unknown,
but it is possible thet it was John de Allhallowgate, who
wrote a portion of the second metrical chronicle‚ some
notiees ot whom will soon be given. The writer sistes
, in the prologus that he drcw up his poem from the
arohivesoi the Minster and then—

“Ne lateat latebris Tabula sic publice fisi.

In the second line of the poem the work is also called
nTobclatom. Now, the Dean and Chapter of York
still possess a Tobata of oak with folding doors in the
shape osa tryptich‚ to the inside of which three pisces
of parchment ere fastened with metal studs. Upon
them this poem is written in a neat hand of the time of
Archbishop Arundel. Unsortunately it hos been much
injured hy damp ond dirt. Upon a similar Tabula are
fastened extracts from Geoffrey of Moumonth and other
historiens, privileges snd professions, endebrief chronicle,
in the form of a calendar, of northern and national
events. of these some notice will he taken in Vol. III.
It may, Ι think, be taken as established that these
Tobnlcc contcin the poem to which the writer alludes,
and the materiale from which it was written The
writing of the two is the same, and of the same dote..

The MS. in this Tabula is the text which Ihave used,
and where it is defective I rely upon two MSS„ viz. :-

B. MS. Cotton, Titus A. xire, ff. 6-11. ’
