viction cannot be avoided that Hugh and Thurstan were
companions in the course 61 the archbishop's banishment
from England. Thurstan, who had the gift 61 attracting
others, might deern himself fortunate in possessing such
a friend. The whole 61 Hugh's narrative is full 61
interest and novelty, and 11 he had given us what 116
could have done so easily and well, some 16111161 sketches
61 local or general history, we should have been infi-
nitely obliged to him. But 1116 just claims 61 the see 61
York and the wrongs 61 his diocesan were burnt in upon
his mind, and he almost sternly casts aside as alien and
impertinent everything that diverted him from the duty

had resolved to set forth. What charming picturas he

The MS. 61 this history is to he found at the begin·
ning 611116 Registrum Magnum Album 61 the 116611
and Chapter 61 York. It forms an appropriate com-
mendement to that noble repository 61 ancient evidences
