Ο. MS. Cotton, Cleopatra, Ο. iv. This is a eto. MS ,on
paper writteninanorthern hand of the15th century. The
poem is imperfect, commencing with line 204. At the
end of thie volume are a number of letters to and from
aMr. Wm. Swem, who seems to have been connected
with Gardinal Kempe. The volume also contains various

Papal Bulls relating to the early Scottish bishops.

The second metrical chronicle, after four short pre-
fatory chapters, begins with Paulinus and ends with
Archbishop William Booth. It gives a short account of
the lives of 62 amhbishopS, in 6081ines, written in
leonine verse, full of life and spirit.

The first lines of the prefatory remarks show that this
poem is the work of two persons. The first is John de
Allhallowgate, who is said to have gone as far as
Wilfrid 11, de, scarcely one fourth of the whole work ;
the second is spriest in the same church with Allhallow·
gete. Now Allhallowgate is the neme of a street in
Ripon. We must look, therefore, to the history os that
place to sce il any mention of John de Allhcllowgate can
be found It appears that on the 17th July 1365, the
Chapter of Ripon gave their assent to the foundation of
a chentry at the altar of St. John the Evangeh'st in their
minster by John de Shirwood. Associated with tho
founder in his petitionis John de Allhsllowgate who
was interested in the act, not as co-founder, hut as the
first chentry-priest (MemorialsofRipon, i. 160). He was
instituted to that office on rand November 1365 (Reg.
Thoreshy). He had apparently been connected with Ripon
ior many yeam, as we find a person of his name witnes·
sing two charters at Ripon in 1344 (Memorials of Ripon
i. 141-144).

On October reth, 1374, llllhallowgate is included in
a commission from Archbishop N eville and is described
