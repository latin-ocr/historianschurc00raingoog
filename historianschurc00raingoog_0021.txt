Senatus Bravonius. According to the Annals of Wor- ἵ
cester (Anglia Sacra, i. 477-8) hc became prior in 1189,
and resigned the office in 1196. A Bible written by
him is in the library at O. O. 0., Cambridge, No. 48.

The object of Senatus in compiling this Life was to
add to the dignity and wealtb of his own monastery, in
which tho bones oi Oswald were enshrined. Senatus
writes pleasantly enough, but his information is in the
main derived from Eadmer, and what he adde is of little
value. ι
This Life by Senatus exists in asingle MS. in England,
viz, B. iv, 39, in the library of the Dean and Chapter
of Durham. It is very nicely written in 4to. in a hand
of the meh century.l Immediately aiter it in the MS.
and in the same bandwriting come the Life and Miracles
of St. Wulstan of Worcester. Leland, Belo, and Pits
assign to Senatus a Life of Wulsten, which might be
very reasonably expected from his pen. Whether this is
the work or not it is not easy to say. The association of
these two Lives in the MS. at Durham is enough perhaps
to account for the ascriptiones both of them to Senatus.
Still the truth of the ascription is by no means impro-
bable. Forafurther account oi this MS. aee the catalogue
of the MSS. at Durham, pp. 244-5. For this Life by
Sanctae, aee Sarius (October 15), 229.

The Passio S. Osweldi in the library of Peterborough
Oathedral, D. 2, 4, is that οξ king, not archbishop,
Oswald.

Another Life, drawn from the anonymous biography of
Oswald with which Vol. Ι. concludes‚is in tho Historia
Raurseiensis, and is printed by Gale, i. 409, and by Mabil- ,
lon, Acta SS. Ord. Rem, vii. 715. This cannot properly
be separated from the Ma, of which it is only a part,
The whole work has been reeently edited in this series
