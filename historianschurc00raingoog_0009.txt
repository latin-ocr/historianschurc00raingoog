os the aoth of J anuary 1857, the Mastcr oi the Rolls
submitled to the Troasury a proposal for the publication
of materiale for the History oi this Oountry from the
Invasion of the Romans to the reign of Henry VIII.

The Mastcr of the Rolls suggested that thcsc materials
should he selected for publIcation under competent
editors without reference to periodica} or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgmcnt, prefer-
ence being given, in thc first instance, to such materials

as were most scarce and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical docu-
. ment tc be corten should he treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps ; and
for this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation oi the best MSS.

'Io render the work more generally useful, the Mastcr
oi thc Itolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, oi their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a
brief account of the life and times of the author, and
any remarks necessary to explain tho chronology ; but
no other note or comment was to bc allowed, except
what might be necessary to establlsh tho correctness of

the text. a 2
